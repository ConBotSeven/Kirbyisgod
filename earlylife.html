	<h2><strong>Where did Kirby come from?<strong></h2>
	<p>Kirby's true origins are unknown, but it sometimes is stated that Void, who is the God of the Kirby universe, created him after coming across a lot of positive emotions. He just showed up on Popstar one day and he's lived there ever since.</p>
	
	<h2><strong>Kirby's Friends</strong></h2>
	<p>Kirby doesn't have any known family members, but he has a few friends such as Bandana Waddle Dee, King Dedede, and Meta Knight, who typically only challenge Kirby when they're under the influence of evil or just for a friendly battle. They have all been with him since the beginning. There are more friends of his, such as Rick, Kine, Coo, and Gooey but it would take a while to list them all.</p>
	
	<h2><strong>Kirby's Early Influences</strong></h2>
    <p>Kirby didn't really have any early influences, he is just the embodiment of good and goes to fight evil in the first game.</p>
